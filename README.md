# Why?

Good question. Once in Tmux there are plenty of sessionn navigation options but when coming in fresh I was always stuck awkwardly typing "tmux ls" because I'm bad at remembering what I name my sessions. Then I would have to go through the arduous journey of typing "tmux a -t {session_name}". Look at how many letters that is...

Joking aside, it's been slightly helpful in my workflow and I liked making it. That's why.
